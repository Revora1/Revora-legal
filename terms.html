    <h2>5. Boosted Posts</h2>
    <p>Users may “boost” images by watching a rewarded advertisement. Boosted images appear at the front of the feed for 12 hours. Each user may boost up to two images within any 12-hour period. All boosted content must still comply with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h2>10. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of Revora after updates means you accept the revised Terms.</p>
